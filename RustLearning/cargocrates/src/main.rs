// some notes on cargo and crate.io because its not relevant to what I wanna do
fn main() {
    /*
    different release profiles are predefined and 
    customizable profiles with different configurations

    publishing crates to crates.io you can put in your functions
    and structs and other things in a library crate
    
    cargo install command allows you to install and use binary crates locally
