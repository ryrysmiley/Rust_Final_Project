    structs and ownership
    In our user definition we used String instead of &str string slice type
    because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for 
    that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.
    Structs can store references but it requires the use of lifetimes.
    Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long
    as the struct is.
